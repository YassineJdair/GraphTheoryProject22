This Repository consists of two Jupyter notebooks for the end of year asssessment for GraphTheory 21/22.



# Contents.

### Heap Sort NoteBook.

* Explanation of the Heap Sort algorithm
* Python function implementing Heap Sort.
* Explanation of the computational complexity of Heap Sort.
* Explanation of how graph theory is used in Heap Sort.


### Graph Isomorphism NoteBook.

* Explanation of the Graph Iomorphism Problem.
* Explanation of how graphs can be represented in data structures.
* Python function implementing an algorithm to determine if two graphs are isomorphic or not.
* Discussion of the computational complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.
